# Git Flow Workflow

Git Flow is a branching model for Git that helps teams streamline the development process and manage releases effectively. It provides a structured approach to branching and merging, making collaboration and version control easier.

## Branches

- **`master`**: The main branch where production-ready code resides. It should always contain stable and releasable code.

- **`develop`**: The development branch where ongoing development takes place. Feature branches are merged into this branch for integration testing.

- **Feature Branches**: Created for developing new features or enhancements. These branches are derived from `develop` and merged back into `develop` upon completion.

- **Hotfix Branches**: Created to fix critical issues in the production code. They are derived from `master`, fixed, and then merged back into both `master` and `develop`.

## Workflow

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Create a New Feature Branch**: Create a new feature branch off the `develop` branch for your feature development.
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   ```

3. **Work on the Feature**: Make your code changes on the feature branch and commit regularly.
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature functionality"
   ```

4. **Push the Feature Branch**: Push your feature branch to the remote repository.
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-feature
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request**: Create a pull request from your feature branch to the `develop` branch using the repository's platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab). Assign reviewers and discuss changes if needed.

6. **Review and Merge**: Reviewers approve and merge the pull request. Continuous integration tests are triggered.

7. **Release Preparation**:
   - When enough features are merged into `develop`, create a new release branch from `develop`.
   - Update version numbers and prepare release notes.

8. **Merge into Master**: Once the release is thoroughly tested on the release branch, merge it into the `master` branch.
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git merge release/my-release
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
   ```

9. **Merge into Develop**: Merge the release branch back into the `develop` branch.
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git merge release/my-release
   ```

10. **Hotfixes**: In case of critical issues in the production code, create a hotfix branch from `master`, fix the issue, and merge it back into both `master` and `develop`.

# Git Flow Workflow with `git-flow`

Git Flow is a branching model for Git that helps teams streamline the development process and manage releases effectively. It provides a structured approach to branching and merging, making collaboration and version control easier. The `git-flow` package is used to simplify the Git Flow workflow.

## Installation

To use `git-flow`, you need to install the package:

```bash
# Install git-flow on your system
brew install git-flow (for macOS)
apt-get install git-flow (for Ubuntu/Debian)
```

## Workflow

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Initialize Git Flow**: Initialize `git-flow` in your repository to set up the branching structure.
   ```bash
   git flow init -d
   ```

3. **Create a New Feature Branch**: Create a new feature branch off the `develop` branch for your feature development.
   ```bash
   git flow feature start my-feature
   ```

4. **Work on the Feature**: Make your code changes on the feature branch and commit regularly.
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature functionality"
   ```

5. **Finish the Feature**: Finish the feature when your work is complete. This will merge your feature branch into the `develop` branch.
   ```bash
   git flow feature finish my-feature
   ```

6. **Create a Release Branch**: Create a new release branch from the `develop` branch.
   ```bash
   git flow release start v1.0.0
   ```

7. **Work on the Release**: Update version numbers and prepare release notes. Test the release.
   ```bash
   # Update version numbers and prepare for release
   git flow release finish v1.0.0
   ```

8. **Hotfixes**: In case of critical issues in the production code, create a hotfix branch from `master`, fix the issue, and merge it back into both `master` and `develop`.
   ```bash
   git flow hotfix start hotfix-name
   git flow hotfix finish hotfix-name
   ```

9. **Publishing**: To share branches and tags on the remote repository, use the `git flow publish` command.
   ```bash
   git flow publish feature my-feature
   ```

## Guidelines

- Keep commits focused and atomic, addressing a single change or feature.
- Regularly update your local branches from the remote using `git pull`.
- Delete feature branches after merging to keep the repository clean.
- Use descriptive commit messages to explain changes.
- Document your code and update the README as necessary.

Customize this README template based on your team's specific workflow and conventions. The `git-flow` package simplifies the Git Flow workflow by providing commands to manage branches effectively.
